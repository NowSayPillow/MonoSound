v1.2.0.0
- Added support for sounds located in XACT sound and wave banks
   (Dislaimer: any looping data stored in the sounds is effectively removed.  Looping sounds
   will have to be set manually in code via SoundEffectInstance.IsLooped)
- Added a sub-manager for streaming sound effects from compiled XNB files and XACT wave banks.
   (Disclaimer: streamed sounds cannot have filters applied to them.)

v1.1.0.0
- Implemented the Freeverb (Reverb) and Echo sound filters from SoLoud
- Sound files can now be passed through multiple filters at once
- OGG Vorbis file format support (.ogg) via NVorbis
- MonoSoundManager contains a new property, AllowEchoOversampling, which controls
   whether the Echo filter is allowed to extend the original sound by over 30 seconds
- MonoSound can now write the sampled sound to a file.  Set the
   MonoSoundManager.LogDirectory property to the directory where the sounds will be
   saved to and set MonoSoundManager.LogFilters to true to enable saving to files
